# Marmite

> Marmite is a fast, minimal static site generator written in Rust that converts Markdown files into HTML websites. It's designed for simplicity and includes features like live reloading, RSS feeds, and a built-in development server.

Marmite is the easiest static site generator optimized for blogs. It doesn't require specific folder structure or complex configuration - the goal is that a blog can be generated simply by running Marmite on a folder with Markdown and media files. Written in Rust, it provides very fast builds with everything included in a single binary.
